# Kepler-Exoplanet-Classification  
**Classifying Exoplanets from NASA’s Kepler Dataset: A Machine Learning Comparative Study**  

## Project Overview  
This project tackles the challenge of distinguishing confirmed exoplanets from false positives using the **NASA Kepler Exoplanet Search Dataset**. By comparing three different machine learning approaches — **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, and **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** — the study highlights trade-offs between accuracy, probability calibration, and inference speed in astrophysical classification tasks.  

The ultimate goal is to identify which model best fits different operational contexts — from high-stakes confirmation to rapid, low-latency screening in real-time telescope pipelines.

## Research Questions  
1. Which machine learning model achieves the highest classification accuracy and reliability for identifying exoplanets?  
2. How does probability calibration differ between MLP, RF, and KNN, and in which scenarios is it most important?  
3. What are the trade-offs between accuracy and inference speed when applying these models to real-world astronomical pipelines?

## Dataset  
- **Source**: [NASA Kepler Exoplanet Search Results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results)  
- **Size**: 9,564 objects with physical and observational parameters  
- **Target Variable**: Binary label derived from `koi_disposition` (`CONFIRMED` = 1, `FALSE POSITIVE` = 0, with `CANDIDATE` removed)  
- **Key Features**: Orbital period, transit duration, transit depth, signal-to-noise ratio, and NASA false positive flags  

---

## Methodology  

**Preprocessing**  
- Dropped irrelevant identifiers and high-missingness columns  
- Removed potential leakage features like `koi_score`  
- Median imputation for missing numeric values  
- Outlier handling: created both “cleaned” and “no-treatment” datasets  
- Standardized numeric features  

**Modeling Approach**  
- **MLP**: Regularization (L2, Dropout), early stopping, hyperparameter tuning via KerasTuner  
- **RF**: OOB-based hyperparameter optimization, class balancing  
- **KNN**: Stratified k-fold cross-validation to select optimal k  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
- Primary: **LogLoss** (binary cross-entropy) for probability quality  
- Secondary: Accuracy, AUC, Average Precision (AP), Expected Calibration Error (ECE), inference time

## Key Results  
| Model | Accuracy | AUC | LogLoss | ECE | Inference Speed |
|-------|----------|-----|---------|-----|----------------|
| **Random Forest** | 96.45% | 0.9906 | 0.1098 | 0.0194 | 0.114 ms/sample |
| **MLP** | 95.36% | 0.9868 | 0.1414 | **0.0115** | 0.096 ms/sample |
| **KNN** | 93.03% | 0.9736 | 0.2925 | 0.0121 | **0.078 ms/sample** |

**Insights**  
- **RF**: Best overall for accuracy and precision–recall performance in high-stakes confirmation  
- **MLP**: Most stable and best-calibrated for probability ranking tasks  
- **KNN**: Fastest, ideal for real-time candidate filtering

## Expected Impact  
- Improve the automation of exoplanet confirmation  
- Enable faster and more reliable pre-selection for telescope follow-up  
- Serve as a benchmark for applying ML to astronomical datasets
